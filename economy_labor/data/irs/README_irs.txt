IRS SOI county-to-county migration flows extracted for selected counties.
Counts reflect returns; schemas vary by year, script normalizes common columns.
Notes:
- Link finder accepts CSV/XLS/XLSX/ZIP and resolves relative URLs.
- Year label matches 'YYYY-YYYY', 'YYYYâ€“YYYY' (en-dash), or 'YYYY to YYYY'.
- 'returns' uses N1/Return_Num/Returns/NRET where available; otherwise falls back.
- Origin/Destination columns recognized across multiple historical name variants.
